# Zapp Android Wallet

Zapp is a privacy-focused Android wallet forked from [Zodl](https://github.com/zodl-inc/zodl-android)
(v3.3.1, tag `upstream/zodl-3.3.1`), itself a fork of Electric Coin Company's
[Zashi](https://github.com/Electric-Coin-Company/zashi-android). On top of the
upstream Zcash wallet it adds:

- ZappMessaging — end-to-end encrypted P2P chat over Hyperswarm
- 4-tab navigation shell (Wallet · Chats · Contacts · Settings)
- Balance history chart on the Wallet home
- Testnet toggle consolidated into the build flavor
- Zapp rebrand (`ZappPalette`, app name, version 4.x)
- Swiss-minimalist UI system (`ZappTheme`) with full design-token migration across all screens

## Quickstart

Prereqs: JDK 17 (`JAVA_HOME` set), Android SDK with NDK `27.0.12077973` and CMake `4.1.2`, an emulator or device with `adb` reachable. The two sibling repos must live next to this one:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JustZappIt/zappMessaging.git ../zappMessaging
git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-kit.git ../bare-kit

./gradlew :app:installZcashtestnetStoreDebug
adb shell monkey -p xyz.justzappit.zapp.testnet.debug -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
```

This branch pins `ZCASH_NETWORK=testnet` in `gradle.properties`, so only `Zcashtestnet*` Gradle tasks are registered. To build mainnet, override at invocation: `./gradlew -PZCASH_NETWORK=mainnet :app:installZcashmainnetStoreDebug`. Full setup, exact versions, and troubleshooting live in [Build Environment](#build-environment--exact-versions) below; deeper end-to-end steps in [`DEVELOPER_SETUP.md`](DEVELOPER_SETUP.md).

## peer.xyz Integration

Zapp integrates [peer.xyz](https://peer.xyz) as the primary fiat on/off-ramp, with [justzappit.xyz](https://justzappit.xyz/directory) as a fallback in unsupported regions.

### Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **A — Onramp** | Get ZEC button on Home, Buy CTA on zero-balance widget and insufficient-funds sheet, branded Chrome Custom Tabs, region detection | ✅ Complete |
| **B — Offramp** | "Cash out" in More screen, "Convert" on received transaction detail, offramp bottom sheet with ZEC → fiat conversion, local ZEC-arrived notification | ✅ Complete |
| **C — Provider builds** | ZKP2P provider templates for PIX (BR), UPI (IN), GCash (PH) — drafts in `zkp2p-providers/`; M-Pesa deferred pending Q6 | 🔄 Needs live capture |
| **D — Facilitator mode** | Earnings dashboard, "Settle via peer.xyz" button, facilitator preference toggle | ⏳ Not started |

### Phase C — What's needed before PR submission

Provider drafts are in `zkp2p-providers/`. Each needs live validation using the `create-zkp2p-provider` skill with Chrome DevTools MCP:

1. Attach to an authenticated Chrome session on the target platform (Nubank / Google Pay / GCash)
2. Navigate transaction history → capture the exact API endpoint with `list_network_requests` + `get_network_request`
3. Verify JSONPath selectors match the live response shape
4. Test end-to-end at `https://developer.peer.xyz` with PeerAuth — run `AUTHENTICATE` → `PROVE`
5. On success: set `"status": "live"` in `zkp2p-providers/providers.json`, remove the country code from `PeerXyzUtil.UNSUPPORTED_REGIONS`

M-Pesa (KE/TZ/UG/GH) is blocked on Q6: whether M-Pesa confirmation is accessible via HTTPS or SMS-only. See `zkp2p-providers/mpesa/PENDING.md`.

### Open questions (peer.xyz team)

| # | Question | Blocks |
|---|----------|--------|
| Q4 | Exact offramp URL format and amount unit | Phase B going live |
| Q5 | Does `referrer=Zapp` appear in analytics? Partner registration needed? | Attribution |
| Q6 | M-Pesa confirmation: HTTPS or SMS-only? | Phase C M-Pesa |
| Q7 | Provider review process + staging validator URL | Phase C all providers |

### Phase D — Facilitator mode (not started)

Facilitators pay local fiat to merchants and accumulate ZEC. Phase D adds:
- `FacilitatorRepository` — DataStore-backed `isFacilitatorMode: Flow<Boolean>`
- `GetTodayEarningsUseCase` — sums today's received ZEC
- Facilitator dashboard screen (today's earnings + "Settle via peer.xyz" → reuses Phase B offramp sheet)
- Conditional "Facilitator Dashboard" item in More screen
- Gated on Phase C: useful only once PIX/UPI/GCash providers are live

## UI Design System (`feat/newUI`)

A new Swiss-minimalist design system (`ZappTheme`) has been introduced and applied across all screens. Key changes:

### Design Standards
- **Colors** — all screens now use `ZappTheme.colors.*` tokens (warm off-white backgrounds, `#FF9417` orange accent). Legacy `ZashiColors`, `ZcashTheme.colors`, and raw `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` references have been replaced.
- **Typography** — all screens use `ZappTheme.typography.*` tokens. `ZashiTypography`, `RobotoMonoFontFamily`, and `MaterialTheme.typography` references have been replaced.
- **Shapes** — no rounded corners anywhere. All `RoundedCornerShape` and `CircleShape` usage has been replaced with `RectangleShape` (flat Swiss geometry).
- **Back button placement** — back buttons have moved from the top-left app bar to a `ZappBottomActionBar` at the bottom-left, horizontally aligned with the primary CTA so the thumb can reach both without stretching.

### New Component: `ZappBottomActionBar`
Added to `ui-design-lib/.../component/zapp/ZappComponents.kt`. Renders `ZappBackButton` on the left and an optional primary action composable on the right, with `windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.navigationBars)` for edge-to-edge correctness.

### Migrated Screens
| Screen | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| `ChatRoomView` | Replaced `MaterialTheme` + Material3 `TopAppBar` with `ZappScreenHeader` + `ZappBottomActionBar`; message bubbles use `RectangleShape` |
| `ChatProfileView` | Replaced `MaterialTheme`, `Card`, `CircleShape` with Zapp tokens; square avatar with accent background |
| `ChatSettingsView` | Replaced `MaterialTheme`, `Surface`, `HorizontalDivider` with `ZappGroupHeader`/`ZappRow`/`ZappRowDivider` |
| `ContactEditView` | Replaced Material3 `TopAppBar` + `Button` with `ZappScreenHeader` + `ZappBottomActionBar` |
| `NewConversationView` | Replaced Material3 scaffold with `ZappScreenHeader` + `ZappBottomActionBar`; contact chips use Zapp surface tokens |
| `ChatListView` | Back button moved from `ZappScreenHeader.left` to bottom-left (aligned with FAB) |
| `ChatContactsView` | Same as `ChatListView` |
| `MoreView` | Replaced `ZashiSmallTopAppBar` with `ZappScreenHeader`; `ZappBottomActionBar` added |
| `AddressBookView` | Back button moved to `ZappBottomActionBar` |
| `SendView` | Replaced `ZashiTopAppbar`/`BlankBgScaffold` with `ZappScreenHeader`+`ZappBottomActionBar`; all `ZashiColors`/`ZashiTypography`/`RobotoMonoFontFamily`/`ZashiDimensions` replaced with Zapp tokens |
| `ReceiveView` | Replaced `ZashiTopAppbar`/`BlankBgScaffold`; address panel color-mode theming replaced with flat Zapp surface tokens; `RoundedCornerShape` → `RectangleShape` |
| `SwapView` | Replaced `ZashiSmallTopAppBar`+back with `ZappScreenHeader`+`ZappBottomActionBar`; all color/typography tokens migrated |
| `TransactionDetailView` | Replaced `GradientBgScaffold`+`ZashiSmallTopAppBar` with flat `Scaffold`+`ZappScreenHeader`; `ZappBackButton` added to bottom action row |
| `ScanView` | Removed `ScanTopAppBar`; back button moved into `ScanBottomItems` using `ZappBackButton` |
| `RequestView` | Replaced `RequestTopAppBar`+`OldZashiBottomBar` with `ZappScreenHeader`+`ZappBottomActionBar` |
| `HomeView` | Legacy spacing tokens (`ZashiDimensions`, `ZcashTheme.dimens`) replaced with direct dp values |

# Build Environment — exact versions

Most build problems on a fresh machine come down to a mismatched JDK, Android
SDK component, or the sibling `../bare-kit` / `../zappMessaging` repos not
being checked out next to `zodl-android`. This section lists the exact versions
known to build this branch cleanly.

## Host

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | 26.3.1 (Darwin 25.3.0, `arm64`, Apple Silicon) | Linux and Windows are supported by upstream, but not verified on this branch. |
| Android Studio | **Narwhal 2025.3.2** — build `AI-253.30387.90.2532.14935130` | Any recent Android Studio on the Narwhal (`AI-253`) channel should work; older channels have not been tested. |

## JDK

| Tool | Version | How it's selected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JDK | **17** — any OpenJDK 17 LTS build works (Temurin and Azul Zulu are both verified) | `gradle/daemon-jvm.properties` pins the Gradle daemon to JDK 17 automatically; Gradle will auto-provision one if not present. Point `JAVA_HOME` at a JDK 17 install for first-launch `./gradlew` commands on machines where auto-provisioning hasn't run yet. JDK 18+ causes a Kotlin compiler parse error on startup — if you see `IllegalArgumentException: <number>`, your `JAVA_HOME` is wrong. |
| Android JVM target | **1.8** (`ANDROID_JVM_TARGET=1.8`) | Android doesn't support bytecode targets beyond Java 8; don't change this. |

If you see `Failed to read key AndroidDebugKey from store ...debug.keystore` or
`Algorithm HmacPBESHA256 not available`, your `JAVA_HOME` is pointing at a JDK
older than 17 — upgrade or delete `~/.android/debug.keystore` and let it
regenerate.

## Build system

| Tool | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gradle | **8.14.4** | Pinned by the wrapper (`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`); never invoke a system-installed `gradle`, always use `./gradlew`. |
| Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) | **8.13.2** (`ANDROID_GRADLE_PLUGIN_VERSION`) | |
| Kotlin | **2.3.10** (`KOTLIN_VERSION`) | |
| Kotlin Compose Compiler | **1.5.15** (`ANDROIDX_COMPOSE_COMPILER_VERSION`) | |
| Detekt | 1.23.8 | |
| ktlint | 1.8.0 | |

## Android SDK components

Install these via Android Studio's **SDK Manager** (Preferences → Languages &
Frameworks → Android SDK). The versions below are exactly what `gradle.properties`
expects; if a different version is installed, Gradle will try to download the
correct one on first build.

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| `compileSdk` / `targetSdk` | **36** |
| `minSdk` | **27** |
| Build Tools | **36.1.0** |
| Platform Tools (`adb`) | 36.0.0 (ADB protocol 1.0.41) |
| Android NDK | **27.0.12077973** (exact — required by `bare-kit`'s native code) |
| CMake | **4.1.2** (installed under `$ANDROID_HOME/cmake/`) |

The NDK and CMake versions are not negotiable — `bare-kit` is built with
CMake against a specific NDK ABI. Newer NDK versions (27.1.x, 28.x) will be
detected but Gradle will download the pinned 27.0.12077973 alongside them.

## Sibling repositories (composite build)

`zodl-android`'s `settings.gradle.kts` includes **two sibling projects that
must be checked out next to this repo on disk**:

```
<some-dir>/
  zodl-android/        <-- this repo
  zappMessaging/       <-- required
  bare-kit/            <-- required
```

If the directory layout differs, Gradle fails with a "project directory does
not exist" error before any Kotlin compilation happens. Clone both:

```sh
# P2P messaging SDK (JustZappIt org)
git clone https://github.com/JustZappIt/zappMessaging.git  ../zappMessaging

# Native P2P transport — upstream Holepunch library, used unmodified
# Pin to the same commit recorded in .zapp-deps (currently v2.0.0)
git clone --branch v2.0.0 https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-kit.git ../bare-kit
```

Pinned commit SHAs for both siblings are in [`.zapp-deps`](.zapp-deps).
CI verifies the checked-out SHAs match before building.

## Key runtime libraries

Pinned in `gradle.properties` and reused via the version catalog in
`settings.gradle.kts`. You don't install these — Gradle does — but when a
dependency resolution error blames one of them, these are the versions in
play:

| Area | Library | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compose | `androidx.compose.ui / foundation / material3` | UI/Foundation **1.10.4**, Material3 **1.3.1**, Icons **1.7.8** |
| AndroidX | `activity`, `lifecycle`, `navigation-compose`, `fragment` | Activity **1.12.4**, Lifecycle **2.10.0**, Navigation **2.9.7**, Fragment **1.8.9** |
| AndroidX | `core-ktx`, `splashscreen`, `work-runtime`, `browser` | Core **1.17.0**, Splash **1.2.0**, Work **2.11.1**, Browser **1.9.0** |
| AndroidX | `camera-camera2 / lifecycle / view` | **1.5.3** |
| AndroidX | `biometric / biometric-ktx` | **1.4.0-alpha05** |
| AndroidX | `security-crypto` | **1.1.0** |
| DI | `io.insert-koin:koin-android` | **4.1.1** |
| Coroutines | `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-*` | **1.10.2** |
| Serialization | `kotlinx-serialization-json` | **1.10.0** |
| Images | `io.coil-kt:coil-compose` | **2.6.0** |
| Location | `com.google.android.gms:play-services-location` | **21.3.0** |
| QR scan (store variant) | `com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning` | **17.3.0** |
| QR render | `com.google.zxing:core` | **3.5.4** |
| Zcash | `cash.z.ecc.android:zcash-android-sdk` | **2.4.8** |
| Zcash | `cash.z.ecc.android:kotlin-bip39` | **1.0.9** |
| Crypto | `com.google.crypto.tink:tink-android` | **1.20.0** |
| Keystone | `com.github.KeystoneHQ:keystone-sdk-android` | **0.8.3** |
| Flexa | `co.flexa:core / spend` | **1.1.2** |
| Animations | `com.airbnb.android:lottie-compose` | **6.6.4** |
| Desugaring | `com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs` | **2.1.5** |

To confirm any of these on your machine: `./gradlew :ui-lib:dependencies --configuration zcashmainnetStoreDebugRuntimeClasspath`.

## Building for Testnet

The app supports both Zcash Mainnet and Testnet. Network is selected at build time via
the `network` product flavor (`zcashmainnet` / `zcashtestnet`) and the two apps can be
installed side-by-side — testnet builds get a `.testnet` application-ID suffix.

Pick a variant directly:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleZcashtestnetStoreDebug
```

Or use the `ZCASH_NETWORK` switch in `gradle.properties` (or `-P` / env var) so the
short task names resolve to a single network:

```sh
# build a testnet debug app — no need to spell out the full variant name
./gradlew -PZCASH_NETWORK=testnet :app:assembleDebug
```

Valid values are `mainnet`, `testnet`, or blank (keep both). The selection is the single
source of truth for both `BuildConfig.FLAVOR_network` and the runtime `R.bool.zcash_is_testnet`
resource — they can't drift. Testnet builds connect to `testnet.zec.rocks:443` by default
(see `ui-lib/.../LightWalletEndpointProvider.kt`).

## One-shot sanity-check build

A clean build from a fresh checkout should succeed with:

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleZcashtestnetStoreDebug
```

(this branch pins `ZCASH_NETWORK=testnet`; for mainnet pass `-PZCASH_NETWORK=mainnet` and use `:app:assembleZcashmainnetStoreDebug`).

If this fails, verify in order:
1. `./gradlew --version` prints `Gradle 8.14.4` and `Launcher JVM: 17.x`.
   (`gradle/daemon-jvm.properties` should select JDK 17 automatically; if it
   shows a higher JDK, set `JAVA_HOME` to a JDK 17 install and stop the daemon
   with `./gradlew --stop` before retrying.)
2. `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/27.0.12077973` exists.
3. `../bare-kit` (holepunchto/bare-kit v2.0.0) and `../zappMessaging` exist as
   siblings. Check `.zapp-deps` for the expected commit SHAs.
4. `gradle.properties` has not been locally modified.

### Zapp-specific build gotchas

- **`WhileSubscribed(Duration)` — unresolved overload.** When using `SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(ANDROID_STATE_FLOW_TIMEOUT)` (where the timeout is a `kotlin.time.Duration`), you must import the Duration extension: `import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.WhileSubscribed`. Without this import the compiler resolves the call to the `Long` overload and fails with _"actual type is Duration, but Long was expected"_.

- **`MaterialColors` not available in `ui-lib`.** `com.google.android.material` is not a declared dependency of `ui-lib`. Do not use `MaterialColors.getColor`. For branded UI colors (e.g., Custom Tab toolbar), use `Color.parseColor("#FF9417")` or a color resource directly.

- **`NavigateToPeerOnrampUseCase.invoke()` is suspend.** All call sites must use `viewModelScope.launch { navigateToPeerOnramp() }`. A bare `navigateToPeerOnramp()` from a non-coroutine function will fail to compile.

- **Shared Gradle build cache poisons the precompiled-script-plugin compile.** Gradle's local build cache (`~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1`) is per-machine, not per-project. The fork's `settings.gradle.kts` includes two extra projects (`:zappmessaging`, `:bare-kit`) that aren't in upstream `zodl-android` / `zodl-android-real`, so the fork's `:build-conventions-secant` produces a different plugin-spec hash. If you build upstream and the fork on the same machine without isolation, kotlinc fails with `Source file or directory not found: …/_<hash>/PluginSpecBuilders.kt` because tasks pull mismatched outputs `FROM-CACHE`. To recover:

  ```
  ./gradlew --stop
  rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/build-cache-1 \
         build-conventions-secant/{build,.gradle,.kotlin} \
         .gradle
  ./gradlew :app:installZcashtestnetFossDebug --no-build-cache
  ```

  Long-term, either always pass `--no-build-cache` when switching between this fork and the upstream repo on the same machine, or set a per-project `GRADLE_USER_HOME` (e.g. `export GRADLE_USER_HOME="$PWD/.gradle-home"`) so each repo has its own cache. Android Studio doesn't hit this because its daemon stays warm and re-uses the same build cache entries it just wrote.

- **JDK 21 required for Gradle, JDK 17 toolchain for project source.** Set `JAVA_HOME` to a JDK 21 install (Android Studio's bundled JBR at `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home` is verified) for the Gradle launcher. Gradle 8.14.4 ships with Kotlin 2.0.21 and that compiler emits Java 21 bytecode for precompiled-script-plugins; running the launcher on JDK 17 surfaces as `class file version 65.0, this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 61.0`. The project's own source is still pinned to `JVM_TOOLCHAIN=17` and Gradle auto-provisions a JDK 17 for it.

# Forking

If you plan to fork the project to create a new app of your own, please make
the following changes.  (If you're making a GitHub fork to contribute back to
the project, these steps are not necessary.)

1. Change the app name under [gradle.properties](gradle.properties)
    1. See `ZCASH_RELEASE_APP_NAME`
1. Change the package name under [app/build.gradle.kts](app/build.gradle.kts)
    1. See `ZCASH_RELEASE_PACKAGE_NAME`
1. Change the support email address under [strings.xml](ui-lib/src/main/res/ui/non_translatable/values/strings.xml)
    1. See `support_email_address`
1. Remove any copyrighted ZCash icons, logos, or assets
    1. ui-lib/src/main/res/common/ - All of the the ic_launcher assets
1. Optional
    1. Configure secrets and variables for [Continuous Integration](docs/CI.md)
    1. Configure Firebase API keys and place them under `app/src/debug/google-services.json` and `app/src/release/google-services.json`

## Code quality — recent cleanup (`feat/newUI`)

The following improvements were made during the peer.xyz integration review pass:

- **`PeerXyzUtil`** — removed the intermediate `buildOnrampUrl`/`buildOfframpUrl` helpers; URLs are inlined directly into the `get*` functions. Comment trimmed to a single line pointing to `zkp2p-providers/`.
- **`TransactionDetailVM`** — `PeerXyzUtil.isPeerAvailable()` is now cached as a `private val` at VM construction (locale is immutable at runtime). The duplicate `ReceiveTransaction.Success → Convert button` block extracted into `createConvertButtonState(Transaction): ButtonState?`.

# Known Issues

1. During builds, a warning will be printed that says "Unable to detect AGP
   versions for included builds. All projects in the build should use the same
   AGP version."  This can be safely ignored.  The version under
   build-conventions is the same as the version used elsewhere in the
   application.
1. When the code coverage Gradle property
   `IS_ANDROID_INSTRUMENTATION_TEST_COVERAGE_ENABLED` is enabled, the debug app
   APK cannot be run.  The coverage flag should therefore only be set when
   running automated tests.
1. Test coverage for Compose code will be low, due to [known limitations](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/1208) in the interaction between Compose and Jacoco.
1. Adding the `espresso-contrib` dependency will cause builds to fail, due to conflicting classes.  This is a [known issue](https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk/issues/306) with the Zcash Android SDK.
1. During app first launch, the following exception starting with `AndroidKeysetManager: keyset not found, will generate a new one` is printed twice.  This exception is not an error, and the code is not being invoked twice.
